## Overview
I designed this Excel Workbook to teach non-technical individuals as well as those new to excel about the power and flexibility that Excel can offer them in their day to day jobs. It is designed to be worked through entirely within excel using different excel sheets, and provides some permanent references for their future work in Excel.

## Screenshots
Below are screenshots of the formula and completed exercise pages of the workbook. The workbook contains both template and completed examples of all 6 exercises for the user to use as a reference or if they get stuck.
